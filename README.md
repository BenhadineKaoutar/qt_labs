# Felgo
Felgo is a cross-platform application development solution, based on the Qt framework and greatly extending it. Felgo offers unique Qt/QML tooling, cloud services, and the Felgo SDK that adds more than 200 APIs extending Qt.

Code savings are not limited to the Qt world, but Felgo is a lot less verbose also compared to native development and competing cross-platform solutions.
